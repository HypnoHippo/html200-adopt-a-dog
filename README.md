# Adopt-A-Dog

## Description

This is a mock dog adoption website that I made for a school assignment using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
We were given designs of what the website should look like when finished and built it based off those. 
You can find those designs in the [comps](https://github.com/HypnoHippo/html200-adopt-a-dog/tree/master/comps) folder.

There are currently some effects like browser pop-ups and glow effects that were added as parts of different assignments.
The blogs on the [blog page](https://hypnohippo.github.io/html200-adopt-a-dog/blog.html) are generated dynamically from an array using Javascript.

Try adding some dogs to your cart and watch the cart total in the top right update as you go!

I tested this website extensively and know it works across all modern browsers for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS. Try visiting the site on your phone!
