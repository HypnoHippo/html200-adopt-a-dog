User Personas:

Name: Harvey Greenwald
Age: 32
Occupation: Used Car Salesman
Activities: Online Poker, Watching TV, and Golf
Description:
Harvey has a full time job that makes decent money, lives alone, and is looking to adopt a dog. 
He uses a computer at work and at home so we can assume he's pretty tech savvy. 
Almost everyone uses a smartphone now and seeing how he's not very old I think it's safe to assume that he might browse the site from a phone also. 
The site should definitely support the most used browsers for desktop and mobile. 
I'd include Edge based off the possibility he might be using a work computer to browse the site during breaks or lunches.


Name: Janet Wilkins
Age: 75
Occupation: Retired
Activities: Gardening, Doing Puzzles, Reading
Description:
Janet is retired and recently widowed. She is looking to adopt a dog for companionship.
She has an older desktop computer and mainly uses it to check emails and occasionally Facebook.
She has a basic "smart"phone that she mainly uses for calling friends, playing some of the pre-installed games, and again, Facebook.
Janet isn't the most computer literate user. She probably hasn't installed any third party browsers and uses Edge, possibly Chrome on the off chance she has.
She doesn't use her phone for more than calls and sometimes Facebook so we probably don't need to worry about her using the site on mobile.
I would make sure the site is compatible with Internet Explorer in case she isn't very good about updating her computer.
I would also make sure that the site is easily usable and readable on an older stock mobile browser just in case she does use the site on a mobile device.


Testing Steps:

*Checked site with the W3C HTML5 validator and CSS validator, passed both.

*Tested site on desktop running Windows 10 with latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. Looks and works good on all 3.

*Tested site on mobile using latest version Android OS with latest version Firefox, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, and stock Android browsers. Looks and works good on all of them.

*Tested site with BrowserStack for Mac (Big Sur) with latest version Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. Everything looked good.

*Tested site with BrowserStack for iOS (iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 11, iPhone X) with latest version Safari and Chrome browsers. Looked good aside from the blog preview
 not showing in landscape mode on iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone X so I tweaked the CSS to fix it.
